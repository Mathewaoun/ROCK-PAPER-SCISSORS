I wanted to share with you a project that I recently completed - coding a rock paper scissors game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
It was a really fun and engaging project, and I learned a lot along the way.
The game itself is quite simple - players choose either rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer chooses a random option as well. 
The winner is determined based on the classic rules of rock paper scissors: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
To create the game, I used JavaScript to handle the game logic and to randomly generate the computer's choice. 
I also used HTML and CSS to design the user interface and create the buttons for the player to choose their option.
